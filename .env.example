# Sample .env file.  Copy this to .env and modify as desired.  Sample values are defaults, unless
# surrounded by angle brackets.  Values in angle brackets are examples and have no default.


##### Timeouts #####

## Helpful for local development. Configure the wait times of timeouts to your needs. All values given in seconds. 
## Note: Official timeout settings for the suite set in settings.py - go there if you need to add a new type or length 
## of timeout to the suite, to be used in scheduled remote runs of the tests.

# QUICK_TIMEOUT=4
# TIMEOUT=10
# LONG_TIMEOUT=30
# VERY_LONG_TIMEOUT=60


##### Driver config #####

## Which browser/software stack to run the tests under.

## DRIVER: which browser to test in.  Valid options are 'Chrome', 'Firefox', 'Remote'
##   'Chrome' requires that chromedriver is available in $PATH
##   'Firefox' requires that geckodriver is available in $PATH
##   'Remote' will run the tests via BrowserStack
##
## HEADLESS: Should selenium hide the browser gui as the tests are being run?
##   True = Hide the gui
##   False = Show the gui
##   Not relevant when DRIVER=Remote

# DRIVER=Firefox
# HEADLESS=False


## If DRIVER=Remote (will be run on BrowserStack), then the following apply and are MANDATORY.
##   TEST_BUILD: This tells BrowserStack which driver to use
##     Valid options are 'chrome', 'firefox', or 'edge'
##   BSTACK_USER: BrowserStack username
##   BSTACK_KEY: BrowserStack api key

# TEST_BUILD=chrome
# BSTACK_USER=<quality-human>
# BSTACK_KEY=<meowmeowmeow>


##### Testing environment #####

## Where to run the tests

## DOMAIN: On what environment will the tests be executed?
##   valid options are: 'test', 'stage1', 'stage2', 'stage3', or 'prod'
##   note: if you do not select a domain, the default is stage1
## PREFERRED_NODE: When DOMAIN=prod, don't create new projects. Instead, run all tests under
##   this guid. MANDATORY if DOMAIN=prod. You must ask QA team for its guid and add it here.
## EXPECTED_PROVIDERS: Only applies when DOMAIN=prod.  A comma-separated list of storage
##   providers connected to the PREFERRED_NODE.

# DOMAIN=stage1
# PREFERRED_NODE=<mst3k>
# EXPECTED_PROVIDERS=bitbucket,box,dataverse,dropbox,figshare,github,gitlab,googledrive,osfstorage,owncloud,onedrive,s3


##### Fixtures #####

## Users: Need to create two users for testing purposes.  Add their logins and passwords here.
##   NB!!!  In a non-prod environment, all these users' nodes will be deleted during the test.
##   DO NOT USE a user with projects you care about.
##
## USER_ONE: Email address of first test user.  User must already exist on DOMAIN env.
## USER_ONE_PASSWORD: Password of first test user.
## USER_TWO: Email address of second test user.  User must already exist on DOMAIN env.
## USER_TWO_PASSWORD: Password of second test user.
## NEW_USER_EMAIL: Email address used for new user signup. Email should be in the form
##   email+{}@gmail.com in order to make unique emails.

# USER_ONE=<foo@example.com>
# USER_ONE_PASSWORD=<i_fear_penguins>
# USER_TWO=<bar@example.com>
# USER_TWO_PASSWORD=<i_fear_polar_beards>
# NEW_USER_EMAIL=<baz+{}@example.com>
